      "contents": "\r\nIntroduction\r\nOn February, 24, 2022 Russia invaded Ukraine. The invasion represents a momentous escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War that has been going on since 2014. The war mainly revolves around the status of strategically significant regions (e.g., Alfarsi, 2022). Since the invasion, over 4.1 million Ukrainian citizens have suddenly had to flee their home country into the unknown (as of April, 1, 2022; Global Conflict Tracker, 2022). People around the globe are moved by the horrifying circumstances Ukrainians are facing day-to-day. The Russia-Ukraine Conflict is all over the news and social media, e.g., Twitter. Twitter is a popular “online, global microblog and social networking service“ (Dodds et al., 2011) with 500 million tweets per day by 217 million daily active users (tweeters; as of February, 21, 2022; Selected Company Metrics and Financials, 2022). But how do tweeters feel towards the matter they choose to address? To what extent do their tweets indicate sentiments, e.g., happiness? What words do they use to express their thoughts on the matter? Quantifying happiness is what the hedonometer (hedonometer.org) aims at: It meters (and visualizes) Twitter users’ “hedonistic“ (positive) emotions (i.e., happiness in this case). Like other sentiment analysis techniques, it assigns sentiment (happiness) scores (ranging continuously from (1) least to (9) most happy) to textual data based on the words included. To do so, it is fed with wordlists corresponding to the language the textual data is in. Wordlists related to the hedonometer currently exist in ten different languages, e.g., English, German, Russian, and Ukrainian. The hedonometer computes the weighted average happiness of texts through the following equation (Qiao & Jiang, 2022):\r\n\r\nFigure 1: The equation the hedonometer computes the weighted average happiness score through (Qiao & Jiang, 2022).\r\n\r\n\r\nwi: word in the text\r\n\r\n\r\nfi: frequency of word\r\n\r\n\r\nN: number of unique words\r\n\r\n\r\nhavg: average happiness\r\n\r\n\r\nhavg(T): average happiness of the whole text\r\n\r\n\r\nhavg(wi): average happiness of a word\r\n\r\n\r\npi: normalized frequency\r\n\r\nSome of the hedonometer’s advantages are:\r\n\r\nIt is capable of processing large, real-time textual data rapidly. This enables to gain large-scale insights into social phenomena on (Dodds & Danforth, 2009; Johnson & Alluri, 2016).\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike surveys, it does not depend on people’s self-reports of their emotional states (Dodds et al., 2011).\r\n\r\n\r\nIts ways of processing data are transparent, therefore their improvement is not restricted to the development team (Dodds & Danforth, 2009).\r\n\r\nOn February, 24 and the days following, a dip in all languages’ average happiness scores can be noticed. However, shortly after, the scores normalize again. This could be due to a habituation effect, similar to the one regarding the COVID-19 pandemic that that has been observed by Dan and Brosius (2021). We therefore are interested in finding answers to the following research question: How fast do average happiness scores of Twitter users tweeting in different languages normalize after February, 24 (i.e., beginning of the Russia-Ukraine Conflict; compared to their average happiness scores before February, 24)?\r\nWhat motivates us to work towards answering our research question?\r\n\r\nSince it revolves around an ongoing conflict, it is highly topical. The data is newly collected.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwitter is a widely used social networking service (Dodds et al., 2011; Selected Company Metrics and Financials, 2022).\r\n\r\n\r\nOur motivation for focusing on the topic of sentiment analyses: expand what we have theoretically learnt about them in the course of a seminar held by the University’s Human-Computer Interaction department in the fall semester 2021.\r\n\r\nMore information:\r\n\r\nOn the hedonometer in general: https://hedonometer.org/timeseries/en_all/?from=2020-10-06&to=2022-04-05\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the wordlists used for the hedonometer (e.g., German): https://hedonometer.org/words/labMT-de-v2/\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the hedonometer’s data: https://hedonometer.org/api.html\r\n\r\nCountries in which languages included in the “hedonometrics“ are officially spoken (in alphabetical order; Infoplease, 2022):\r\n\r\nGerman: Austria; Belgium; Germany; Italy; Liechtenstein; Luxembourg; Switzerland\r\n\r\n\r\nEnglish (third most widely spoken language): Antigua and Barbuda; Barbados; Belize; Botswana; Burundi; Cameroon; Canada; Cape Verde; Dominica; Eritrea; Eswatini; Fiji; Grenada; Guyana; Ireland; Kenya; Kiribati; Lesotho; Liberia; Malawi; Malta; Namibia; New Zealand; Nigeria; Pakistan; Palau; Palestinian State; Papua New Guinea; Philippines; Rwanda; Samoa; Seychelles; Sierra Leone; Singapore; Solomon Islands; South Africa; South Sudan; Sudan; Tanzania; Tonga; Trinidad and Tobago; Tuvalu; Uganda; United Kingdom; United States; Vanuatu; Zambia; Zimbabwe\r\n\r\n\r\nRussian (eighth most widely spoken language): Belarus; Kazakhstan; Kyrgyzstan; Russia\r\n\r\n\r\nUkrainian: Ukraine\r\n\r\n\r\nSpanish (second most widely spoken language): Argentina; Bolivia; Chile; Colombia; Costa Rica; Cuba; Dominican Republic; East Timor; Ecuador; El Salvador; Equatorial Guinea; Guatemala; Honduras; Mexico; Micronesia; Nicaragua; Panama; Paraguay; Peru; Spain; Uruguay; Venezuela\r\n\r\n\r\nPortuguese (seventh most widely spoken language): Angola; Brazil; Equatorial Guinea; Guinea-Bissau; Mozambique; Myanmar; Portugal; Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe\r\n\r\n\r\nFrench: Belgium; Benin; Burkina Faso; Burundi; Cameroon; Canada; Cape Verde; Central African Republic; Chad; Comoros; Democratic Republic of the Congo; Republic of Congo; Côte d’Ivoire; Djibouti; Equatorial Guinea; France; Gabon; Gambia; Guinea; Haiti; Luxembourg; Madagascar; Mali; Monaco; Niger; Rwanda; Senegal; Seychelles; Switzerland; Togo; Vanuatu Chinese\r\n\r\n\r\n: China; Taiwan\r\n\r\n\r\nKorean: North Korea; South Korea\r\n\r\n\r\nArabic (fifth most widely spoken language): Algeria; Bahrain; Chad; Comoros; Djibouti; Egypt; Eritrea; Iraq; Jordan; Kuwait; Lebanon; Libya; Mauritania; Morocco; Oman; Qatar; Saudi Arabia; Somalia; Sudan; Syria; Tunisia; United Arab Emirates; Yemen\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nAlfarsi, H.
