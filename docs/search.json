The invasion\r\nrepresents a momentous escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War that\r\nhas been going on since 2014. The war mainly revolves around the status\r\nof strategically significant regions (e.g., Alfarsi, 2022).\r\nSince the invasion, over 4.1 million Ukrainian citizens have suddenly\r\nhad to flee their home country into the unknown (as of May 18, 2022;\r\nGlobal Conflict Tracker, 2022). People around the globe are moved by the\r\nhorrifying circumstances Ukrainians have since been facing day-to-day.\r\nThe Russia-Ukraine Conflict is all over the news and social\r\nmedia, e.g., Twitter.\r\n1.1 Twitter\r\nTwitter is a popular “online, global microblog and social networking\r\nservice“ (Dodds et al., 2011) with 500 million tweets per day by 217\r\nmillion daily active users (i.e., tweeters; as of February 21, 2022;\r\nSelected Company Metrics and Financials, 2022). But how do tweeters feel\r\ntowards the matters they choose to address? To what extent do their\r\ntweets indicate sentiments, e.g., happiness? What words do they use to\r\nexpress their thoughts on the matters?\r\n1.2 Hedonometer\r\nQuantifying happiness is what the Hedonometer\r\n(hedonometer.org) aims at: It meters (and visualizes) Twitter users’\r\n“hedonistic“ (positive) emotions (i.e., happiness in this case). Like\r\nother sentiment analysis techniques, it assigns sentiment (happiness)\r\nscores (ranging continuously from (1) least to (9) most\r\nhappy) to textual data based on the words included. To do so, it is\r\nfed with wordlists corresponding to the language the textual data is in.\r\nWordlists related to the Hedonometer currently exist in ten different\r\nlanguages, e.g., English, German, Russian and Ukrainian. The\r\nHedonometer computes the weighted average happiness of text through the\r\nfollowing equation (Qiao & Jiang, 2022):\r\n\r\nFigure 1: The equation the hedonometer computes the weighted average\r\nhappiness score through (Qiao & Jiang, 2022).\r\n\r\n\r\nwi: word in the text\r\n\r\n\r\nfi: frequency of word\r\n\r\n\r\nN: number of unique words\r\n\r\n\r\nhavg: average happiness\r\n\r\n\r\nhavg(T): average happiness of the whole text\r\n\r\n\r\nhavg(wi): average happiness of a word\r\n\r\n\r\npi: normalized frequency\r\n\r\nSome of the\r\nHedonometer’s Advantages are:\r\n\r\nIt is capable of processing large, real-time textual data\r\nrapidly. This enables to gain large-scale insights into social phenomena\r\n(Dodds & Danforth, 2009; Johnson & Alluri, 2016).\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike surveys, it does not depend on people’s self-reports of their\r\nemotional states (Dodds et al., 2011).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hedonometer’s ways of processing data are transparent, therefore,\r\ntheir improvement is not restricted to its development team (Dodds &\r\nDanforth, 2009).\r\n\r\n1.3\r\nMotivation – What motivates us to work towards answering our research\r\nquestion (see section below)?\r\n\r\nSince the question revolves around an (unfortunately) ongoing conflict\r\n(We obviously wish for the conflict to end as soon and peacefully as\r\npossible.), it is highly topical. The Hedonometer data is newly and\r\ncontinuously collected.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwitter is a widely used social networking service (Dodds et al., 2011;\r\nSelected Company Metrics and Financials, 2022).\r\n\r\n\r\nOur motivation to initially focus on the topic of sentiment analyses:\r\nexpand what we have theoretically learnt about them in the course of a\r\nseminar (Research methods in Human-Computer Interaction 1) held by the\r\nUniversity’s Human-Computer Interaction department in the fall semester\r\n2021.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost significantly: Terrible incidents take place every day, all around\r\nthe globe. With most people having access to some sort of (online)\r\nmedia, news spread easily and can be commented on by anyone, speaking\r\nany language, being more or less distantly located to and (to different\r\ndegrees) economically dependent on incidents’ regional origins. Usually,\r\npeople feel affected by (and like discussing) incidents as long as they\r\nappear topical to them. For the most part, the time spent informing\r\noneself, thinking and talking about incidents decreases over time, other\r\nthings become personally more significant (e.g., concerning everyday\r\nlife; closely related people). People are usually unaware of the\r\neconomic relationships their home countries maintain with other\r\ncountries in the world. Import/export are relatively abstract constructs\r\nto most people, exclusively cared about by those who can be held\r\nresponsible for. Hyperbolically put, it is generally not until the\r\nnewest iPhone can’t be shipped and delivered quickly to their front\r\ndoor, that “average“ people begin worrying about those economic\r\nrelationships. It might be of interest to policymakers to increase this\r\nawareness. A thought relevant to democratic nations: An overall informed\r\ncitizen also is a more competent voter.\r\n\r\n2 Our project\r\n2.1 Research Question &\r\nOutcome Variables\r\nOn February, 24 and the days following, a drop in all\r\nlanguages’ average happiness scores can be noticed. However, shortly\r\nafter, the scores increase again. This could be due to a habituation\r\neffect, similar to the one regarding the COVID-19 pandemic that has\r\nbeen observed by Dan and Brosius (2021). We, therefore, are\r\ninterested in addressing the following research question:\r\nHow\r\ndo average happiness scores of Twitter users tweeting in different\r\nlanguages develop after February, 24 (i.e., day Russia first invaded\r\nUkraine)?\r\nTo find answers to this question, we look at two outcome\r\nvariables:\r\n\r\nReactivity outcome: average happiness scores (mean, standard\r\ndeviation) one day after the invasion, compared to the average\r\nhappiness scores one day before the invasion  probable drop in\r\naverage happiness scores (see Hypotheses)\r\n\r\n\r\nHabituation: average happiness scores (mean, standard deviation)\r\ntwo weeks after the invasion, compared to the baseline (see next\r\nparagraph) -> tweeters in some languages will likely (already) have\r\nrecovered from their “happiness drop“/returned to their baseline, while\r\nothers will not have recovered entirely from their drop/will not have\r\nreturned to their baseline (yet) (see Hypotheses)\r\n\r\nA baseline (average happiness scores) is needed for the above outcome\r\nvariables:\r\n\r\nBaseline: average happiness scores one month prior to the\r\ninvasion\r\n\r\nWe collected further data on the countries speaking one of the\r\nHedonometer languages:\r\n\r\nTheir capital via [API]: These data were used to calculate each\r\ncountry’s (capital’s) geodistance to Ukraine (Kiev) in\r\nkilometers.\r\n\r\n\r\nA balanced value of import from as well as export to Ukraine in US\r\ndollars via https://data.imf.org/?sk=9d6028d4-f14a-464c-a2f2-59b2cd424b85&sId=1515619375491\r\n\r\nWe initially had intended to incorporate more variables, for instance\r\nimport from and export to Russia. We then would have had to research\r\ninformation on sanctions possibly imposed on Russia for all countries,\r\nwhich would have made our analysis a lot more complex. So, we decided to\r\nstick to the most important variables: geodistance and import\r\nfrom/export to Ukraine.\r\n2.2 Hypotheses\r\n\r\nOn Geodistance: We hypothesize that geodistance has a systematic\r\neffect on people’s affectedness (operationalized as the development of\r\ntheir happiness scores): Twitter users who are geographically\r\nless (vs. more) distantly located to Ukraine (i.e., hotspot of\r\nthe conflict) therefore are expected to show stronger drops in\r\ntheir average happiness scores (reactivity outcome) and (therefore) take\r\nlonger (i.e., more days since the invasion) to recover from the\r\ndrop/still not have returned to their baseline (habituation).\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Economic relationship: We hypothesize that countries’ economic\r\nrelationship to Ukraine does not have a systematic effect on\r\npeople’s affectedness (operationalized as the development of their\r\nhappiness scores): Twitter users therefore are expected to show a\r\ndevelopment of their average happiness scores (reactivity outcome) and\r\ntime to return to their baseline (habituation) that is not\r\nsystematically related to their countries’ economic relationship to\r\nUkraine. This is thought to be due to unawareness of the economic\r\nrelationships and ways those might be affected by the conflict.\r\n\r\n2.3 Methodology\r\nWe were advised to focus on data visualization, as (1)\r\nthis would be most effective to communicate our results to any audience\r\nnot familiar with our project, and because (2) the time to work\r\non our project was limited. So, the goal ultimately became to\r\nvisualize our outcome variables (i.e., reactivity outcome and\r\nhabituation) and in what ways they vary as a function of our predictor\r\nvariables (i.e., geodistance and economic relationship). We\r\nfirst collected the processed data from hedonometer.org as well as the\r\nvariables Language, Capital and Iso2 code (i.e., standard code) for all\r\nrelevant countries. [Work in progress.]\r\n3 Difficulties & Learnings\r\n3.1 Languages ≠ Countries\r\nHedonometrics only differentiate between tweeters’ languages, not the\r\ncountries they are located in. We therefore were challenged to find a\r\nway to still fit the data to our research question. We decided to focus\r\non countries’ first national language.Countries\r\nin which languages included in the “Hedonometrics“ are\r\nofficially spoken (in alphabetical order; Infoplease, 2022):\r\n\r\nSpanish (second most widely spoken language): Argentina; Bolivia;\r\nChile; Colombia; Costa Rica; Cuba; Dominican Republic; East Timor;\r\nEcuador; El Salvador; Equatorial Guinea; Guatemala; Honduras; Mexico;\r\nMicronesia; Nicaragua; Panama; Paraguay; Peru; Spain; Uruguay; Venezuela\r\n\r\n\r\nEnglish (third most widely spoken language): Antigua and Barbuda;\r\nBarbados; Belize; Botswana; Burundi; Cameroon; Canada; Cape Verde;\r\nDominica; Eritrea; Eswatini; Fiji; Grenada; Guyana; Ireland; Kenya;\r\nKiribati; Lesotho; Liberia; Malawi; Malta; Namibia; New Zealand;\r\nNigeria; Pakistan; Palau; Palestinian State; Papua New Guinea;\r\nPhilippines; Rwanda; Samoa; Seychelles; Sierra Leone; Singapore; Solomon\r\nIslands; South Africa; South Sudan; Sudan; Tanzania; Tonga; Trinidad and\r\nTobago; Tuvalu; Uganda; United Kingdom; United States; Vanuatu; Zambia;\r\nZimbabwe\r\n\r\n\r\nArabic (fifth most widely spoken language): Algeria; Bahrain;\r\nChad; Comoros; Djibouti; Egypt; Eritrea; Iraq; Jordan; Kuwait; Lebanon;\r\nLibya; Mauritania; Morocco; Oman; Qatar; Saudi Arabia; Somalia; Sudan;\r\nSyria; Tunisia; United Arab Emirates; Yemen\r\n\r\n\r\nPortuguese (seventh most widely spoken language): Angola; Brazil;\r\nEquatorial Guinea; Guinea-Bissau; Mozambique; Myanmar; Portugal;\r\nDemocratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe\r\n\r\n\r\nRussian (eighth most widely spoken language): Belarus;\r\nKazakhstan; Kyrgyzstan; Russia\r\n\r\n\r\nChinese: China; Taiwan\r\n\r\n\r\nFrench: Belgium; Benin; Burkina Faso; Burundi; Cameroon; Canada;\r\nCape Verde; Central African Republic; Chad; Comoros; Democratic Republic\r\nof the Congo; Republic of Congo; Côte d’Ivoire; Djibouti; Equatorial\r\nGuinea; France; Gabon; Gambia; Guinea; Haiti; Luxembourg; Madagascar;\r\nMali; Monaco; Niger; Rwanda; Senegal; Seychelles; Switzerland; Togo;\r\nVanuatu\r\n\r\n\r\nGerman: Austria; Belgium; Germany; Italy; Liechtenstein;\r\nLuxembourg; Switzerland\r\n\r\n\r\nKorean: North Korea; South Korea\r\n\r\n\r\nUkrainian: Ukraine\r\n\r\n3.2\r\nNon-availability of Absolute Number of Twitter Users per Country\r\nOur idea was to weight geodistance (to Kiev) and economic\r\nrelationship according to the absolute number of Twitter users per\r\ncountry which is part of one of the Hedonometer’s language groups.\r\nUnfortunately, we were unable to find data on absolute numbers of\r\nTwitter users per country. We found this list of numbers instead: https://www.statista.com/statistics/242606/number-of-active-twitter-users-in-selected-countries/\r\n However, only thirteen of the 20 listed countries speak one\r\nof the Hedonometer’s language. We therefore were advised to\r\nstill use this list, but to set the weight of countries not mentioned in\r\nthe list to the minimum value in the list.\r\n3.3 Manually generated Data\r\nvs. APIs\r\nBefore we learnt that there basically is an API to any data one might\r\nbe in need of, we had already researched and typed in (Google\r\nspreadsheet) most geodistance and some economic relationship values by\r\nhand. The following links lead to the sites we had then used:\r\n\r\nGeodistance: https://www.distance.to/\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomic relationship: https://oec.world/en/profile/country/ukr\r\n\r\nObviously, this manual approach was time-consuming and non-necessary\r\n– and we for sure were glad to learn about the APIs – after all, it at\r\nleast helped to get a first feel for the data.\r\n\r\n4 Results\r\nCurrently, we can display the development of the average happiness\r\nscore as well as a baseline graph before the 24.2.2022 (i.e., first day\r\nof invasion) for German Twitter users. Also, we’ve got the\r\nprocessed Hedonometer data as well as the variables Language, Capital\r\nand Iso2 code for all relevant countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHedonometer Data\r\n\r\nlanguage\r\nbaseline_mean\r\nbaseline_sd\r\nreactivity\r\nhabituation\r\nen\r\n6.066484\r\n0.0224601\r\n0.0974839\r\n0.0012211\r\nde\r\n5.959129\r\n0.0260650\r\n0.2571290\r\n0.0016648\r\nru\r\n5.955645\r\n0.1073215\r\n0.5226452\r\n0.0036348\r\nuk\r\n5.658968\r\n0.1686751\r\n0.2389677\r\n0.0039241\r\nes\r\n6.187419\r\n0.0168993\r\n0.1604194\r\n0.0009838\r\npt\r\n6.026968\r\n0.0304067\r\n0.0959677\r\n0.0007376\r\nfr\r\n5.836064\r\n0.0225077\r\n0.3120645\r\n0.0019024\r\nar\r\n6.455935\r\n0.0266982\r\n0.1649355\r\n0.0037011\r\nid\r\n5.938645\r\n0.0202987\r\n0.0736452\r\n0.0001898\r\nko\r\n6.024452\r\n0.0922713\r\n0.0304516\r\n0.0016423\r\n\r\nCountries Data\r\n\r\nlanguage\r\ncountry\r\niso2\r\ncapital\r\nen\r\nAntigua and Barbuda\r\nAG\r\nSt. John’s\r\nen\r\nBarbados\r\nBB\r\nBridgetown\r\nen\r\nBelize\r\nBZ\r\nBelmopan\r\nen\r\nBotswana\r\nBW\r\nGaborone\r\nen\r\nBurundi\r\nBI\r\nBujumbura\r\nen\r\nCameroon\r\nCM\r\nYaounde\r\n\r\nDevelopment\r\nof Happiness (average happiness score) since 24.2.2022:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5 Limitations\r\n[Work in progress.]\r\nMore information\r\n\r\nOn the Hedonometer in general: https://hedonometer.org/timeseries/en_all/?from=2020-10-06&to=2022-04-05\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the wordlists used for the Hedonometer (e.g., English): https://hedonometer.org/words/labMT-en-v2/\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Hedonometer data: https://hedonometer.org/api.html\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nAlfarsi, H.
