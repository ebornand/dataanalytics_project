      "contents": "\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nOn February, 24, 2022 Russia invaded Ukraine. The invasion\r\nrepresents a momentous escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War that\r\nhas been going on since 2014. The war mainly revolves around the status\r\nof strategically significant regions (e.g., Alfarsi, 2022).\r\nSince the invasion, over 4.1 million Ukrainian citizens have suddenly\r\nhad to flee their home country into the unknown (as of April, 1, 2022;\r\nGlobal Conflict Tracker, 2022). People around the globe are moved by the\r\nhorrifying circumstances Ukrainians are facing day-to-day. The\r\nRussia-Ukraine Conflict is all over the news and social media,\r\ne.g., Twitter. Twitter is a popular “online, global microblog\r\nand social networking service“ (Dodds et al., 2011) with 500 million\r\ntweets per day by 217 million daily active users (tweeters; as of\r\nFebruary, 21, 2022; Selected Company Metrics and Financials, 2022). But\r\nhow do tweeters feel towards the matter they choose to address? To what\r\nextent do their tweets indicate sentiments, e.g., happiness? What words\r\ndo they use to express their thoughts on the matter?\r\nQuantifying happiness is what the hedonometer (hedonometer.org)\r\naims at: It meters (and visualizes) Twitter users’ “hedonistic“\r\n(positive) emotions (i.e., happiness in this case). Like other sentiment\r\nanalysis techniques, it assigns sentiment (happiness) scores (ranging\r\ncontinuously from (1) least to (9) most happy) to textual\r\ndata based on the words included. To do so, it is fed with wordlists\r\ncorresponding to the language the textual data is in. Wordlists related\r\nto the hedonometer currently exist in ten different languages, e.g.,\r\nEnglish, German, Russian, and Ukrainian. The hedonometer\r\ncomputes the weighted average happiness of texts through the following\r\nequation (Qiao & Jiang, 2022):\r\n\r\nFigure 1: The equation the hedonometer computes the weighted average\r\nhappiness score through (Qiao & Jiang, 2022).\r\n\r\n\r\nwi: word in the text\r\n\r\n\r\nfi: frequency of word\r\n\r\n\r\nN: number of unique words\r\n\r\n\r\nhavg: average happiness\r\n\r\n\r\nhavg(T): average happiness of the whole text\r\n\r\n\r\nhavg(wi): average happiness of a word\r\n\r\n\r\npi: normalized frequency\r\n\r\nSome of the\r\nhedonometer’s advantages are:\r\n\r\nIt is capable of processing large, real-time textual data\r\nrapidly. This enables to gain large-scale insights into social phenomena\r\non (Dodds & Danforth, 2009; Johnson & Alluri, 2016).\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike surveys, it does not depend on people’s self-reports of their\r\nemotional states (Dodds et al., 2011).\r\n\r\n\r\nIts ways of processing data are transparent, therefore their improvement\r\nis not restricted to the development team (Dodds & Danforth, 2009).\r\n\r\nOn February, 24 and the days following, a dip in all\r\nlanguages’ average happiness scores can be noticed. However, shortly\r\nafter, the scores normalize again. This could be due to a habituation\r\neffect, similar to the one regarding the COVID-19 pandemic that that\r\nhas been observed by Dan and Brosius (2021). We therefore are\r\ninterested in finding answers to the following research question: How\r\nfast do average happiness scores of Twitter users tweeting in different\r\nlanguages normalize after February, 24 (i.e., beginning of the\r\nRussia-Ukraine Conflict; compared to their average happiness scores\r\nbefore February, 24)?\r\nWhat\r\nmotivates us to work towards answering our research question?\r\n\r\nSince it revolves around an ongoing conflict, it is highly topical. The\r\ndata is newly collected.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwitter is a widely used social networking service (Dodds et al., 2011;\r\nSelected Company Metrics and Financials, 2022).\r\n\r\n\r\nOur motivation for focusing on the topic of sentiment analyses: expand\r\nwhat we have theoretically learnt about them in the course of a seminar\r\nheld by the University’s Human-Computer Interaction department in the\r\nfall semester 2021.\r\n\r\nMore information:\r\n\r\nOn the hedonometer in general: https://hedonometer.org/timeseries/en_all/?from=2020-10-06&to=2022-04-05\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the wordlists used for the hedonometer (e.g., German): https://hedonometer.org/words/labMT-de-v2/\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the hedonometer’s data: https://hedonometer.org/api.html\r\n\r\nCountries\r\nin which languages included in the “hedonometrics“ are officially spoken\r\n(in alphabetical order; Infoplease, 2022):\r\n\r\nGerman: Austria; Belgium; Germany; Italy; Liechtenstein; Luxembourg;\r\nSwitzerland\r\n\r\n\r\nEnglish (third most widely spoken language): Antigua and Barbuda;\r\nBarbados; Belize; Botswana; Burundi; Cameroon; Canada; Cape Verde;\r\nDominica; Eritrea; Eswatini; Fiji; Grenada; Guyana; Ireland; Kenya;\r\nKiribati; Lesotho; Liberia; Malawi; Malta; Namibia; New Zealand;\r\nNigeria; Pakistan; Palau; Palestinian State; Papua New Guinea;\r\nPhilippines; Rwanda; Samoa; Seychelles; Sierra Leone; Singapore; Solomon\r\nIslands; South Africa; South Sudan; Sudan; Tanzania; Tonga; Trinidad and\r\nTobago; Tuvalu; Uganda; United Kingdom; United States; Vanuatu; Zambia;\r\nZimbabwe\r\n\r\n\r\nRussian (eighth most widely spoken language): Belarus; Kazakhstan;\r\nKyrgyzstan; Russia\r\n\r\n\r\nUkrainian: Ukraine\r\n\r\n\r\nSpanish (second most widely spoken language): Argentina; Bolivia; Chile;\r\nColombia; Costa Rica; Cuba; Dominican Republic; East Timor; Ecuador; El\r\nSalvador; Equatorial Guinea; Guatemala; Honduras; Mexico; Micronesia;\r\nNicaragua; Panama; Paraguay; Peru; Spain; Uruguay; Venezuela\r\n\r\n\r\nPortuguese (seventh most widely spoken language): Angola; Brazil;\r\nEquatorial Guinea; Guinea-Bissau; Mozambique; Myanmar; Portugal;\r\nDemocratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe\r\n\r\n\r\nFrench: Belgium; Benin; Burkina Faso; Burundi; Cameroon; Canada; Cape\r\nVerde; Central African Republic; Chad; Comoros; Democratic Republic of\r\nthe Congo; Republic of Congo; Côte d’Ivoire; Djibouti; Equatorial\r\nGuinea; France; Gabon; Gambia; Guinea; Haiti; Luxembourg; Madagascar;\r\nMali; Monaco; Niger; Rwanda; Senegal; Seychelles; Switzerland; Togo;\r\nVanuatu Chinese\r\n\r\n\r\n: China; Taiwan\r\n\r\n\r\nKorean: North Korea; South Korea\r\n\r\n\r\nArabic (fifth most widely spoken language): Algeria; Bahrain; Chad;\r\nComoros; Djibouti; Egypt; Eritrea; Iraq; Jordan; Kuwait; Lebanon; Libya;\r\nMauritania; Morocco; Oman; Qatar; Saudi Arabia; Somalia; Sudan; Syria;\r\nTunisia; United Arab Emirates; Yemen\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nAlfarsi, H.
