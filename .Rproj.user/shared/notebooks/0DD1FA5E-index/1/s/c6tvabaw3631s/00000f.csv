"1","# 1 Introduction to the Topic"
"1","
"
"1","On <i>February 24, 2022</i> Russia invaded Ukraine. The invasion represents a momentous escalation of the <i>Russo-Ukrainian War</i> that has been going on since 2014. The war mainly revolves around the status of strategically significant regions (e.g., Alfarsi, 2022).<br/><br/>"
"1","
"
"1","Since the invasion, over 4.1 million Ukrainian citizens have suddenly had to flee their home country into the unknown (as of May 18, 2022; Global Conflict Tracker, 2022). People around the globe are moved by the horrifying circumstances Ukrainians have since been facing day-to-day. The <i>Russia-Ukraine Conflict</i> is all over the news and social media, e.g., Twitter.<br/><br/>"

"1","
"
"1","Twitter is a popular “online, global microblog and social networking service“ (Dodds et al., 2011) with <i>500 million tweets per day by 217 million daily active users</i> (i.e., tweeters; as of February 21, 2022; Selected Company Metrics and Financials, 2022). But how do tweeters feel towards the matters they choose to address? To what extent do their tweets indicate sentiments, e.g., happiness? What words do they use to express their thoughts on the matters?<br/><br/>"

"1","### 1.2 Hedonometer"
"1","
"
"1","Quantifying happiness is what the <i>Hedonometer (hedonometer.org)</i> aims at: It meters (and visualizes) Twitter users’ “hedonistic“ (positive) emotions (i.e., happiness in this case). Like other sentiment analysis techniques, it assigns sentiment (happiness) scores (ranging continuously from <i>(1) least</i> to <i>(9) most happy</i>) to textual data based on the words included. To do so, it is fed with wordlists corresponding to the language the textual data is in. Wordlists related to the Hedonometer currently exist in ten different languages, e.g., English, German, Russian and Ukrainian.<br/><br/>"
"1","

"1","The Hedonometer computes the weighted average happiness of text through the following equation (Qiao & Jiang, 2022):"

"1","
"
"1","</li><li>Unlike surveys, it does not depend on people’s self-reports of their emotional states (Dodds et al., 2011)."

"1","

"1",""
"1","
"
"1","<ul>"
"1","
"
"1","<li>Since the question revolves around an (unfortunately) ongoing conflict (We obviously wish for the conflict to end as soon and peacefully as possible.), it is highly topical. The Hedonometer data is newly and continuously collected.</li>"
"1","
"
"1","<li>Twitter is a widely used social networking service (Dodds et al., 2011; Selected Company Metrics and Financials, 2022).</li>"
"1","

"1","<li>Our motivation to initially focus on the topic of sentiment analyses: expand what we have theoretically learnt about them in the course of a seminar (Research methods in Human-Computer Interaction 1) held by the University’s Human-Computer Interaction department in the fall semester 2021.</li>"
"1","
"
"1","<li>Most significantly: Terrible incidents take place every day, all around the globe. With most people having access to some sort of (online) media, news spread easily and can be commented on by anyone, speaking any language, being more or less distantly located to and (to different degrees) economically dependent on incidents’ regional origins. Usually, people feel affected by (and like discussing) incidents as long as they appear topical to them. For the most part, the time spent informing oneself, thinking and talking about incidents decreases over time, other things become personally more significant (e.g., concerning everyday life; closely related people). People are usually unaware of the economic relationships their home countries maintain with other countries in the world. Import/export are relatively abstract constructs to most people, exclusively cared about by those who can be held responsible for. Hyperbolically put, it is generally not until the newest iPhone can’t be shipped and delivered quickly to their front door, that “average“ people begin worrying about those economic relationships. It might be of interest to policymakers to increase this awareness. A thought relevant to democratic nations: An overall informed citizen also is a more competent voter.</li>"

"
"1",""
"1","
"
"1","On February, 24 and the days following, a <i>drop</i> in all languages’ average happiness scores can be noticed. However, shortly after, the scores increase again. This could be due to a <i>habituation effect</i>, similar to the one regarding the COVID-19 pandemic that has been observed by Dan and Brosius (2021).<br/><br/>"
"1","
"
"1","We, therefore, are interested in addressing the following <i>research question:</i>"
"1","
"
"1",""
"1","
"
"1","### How do average happiness scores of Twitter users tweeting in different languages develop after February, 24 (i.e., day Russia first invaded Ukraine)?"
"1","
"
"1",""
"1","
"
"1","To find answers to this question, we look at two <i>outcome variables:</i>"
"1","
"

"
"1","<ul>"
"1","
"
"1","<li><i>Reactivity outcome:</i> average happiness scores (mean, standard deviation) <i>one day after</i> the invasion, compared to the average happiness scores <i>one day before</i> the invasion  probable drop in average happiness scores (see Hypotheses)</li>"
"1","
"
"1","<li><i>Habituation:</i> average happiness scores (mean, standard deviation) <i>two weeks after</i> the invasion, compared to the baseline (see next paragraph) -> tweeters in some languages will likely (already) have recovered from their “happiness drop“/returned to their baseline, while others will not have recovered entirely from their drop/will not have returned to their baseline (yet) (see Hypotheses)</li>"

"1","
"
"1","<ul>"
"1","
"
"1","<li>On <i>Geodistance:</i> We hypothesize that geodistance has a systematic effect on people’s affectedness (operationalized as the development of their happiness scores): Twitter users who are geographically <i>less</i> (vs. more) distantly located to Ukraine (i.e., hotspot of the conflict) therefore are expected to show <i>stronger</i> drops in their average happiness scores (reactivity outcome) and (therefore) take <i>longer</i> (i.e., more days since the invasion) to recover from the drop/still not have returned to their baseline (habituation).</li>"
"1","
"
"1","<li>On <i>Economic relationship:</i> We hypothesize that countries’ economic relationship to Ukraine does <i>not</i> have a systematic effect on people’s affectedness (operationalized as the development of their happiness scores): Twitter users therefore are expected to show a development of their average happiness scores (reactivity outcome) and time to return to their baseline (habituation) that is <i>not</i> systematically related to their countries’ economic relationship to Ukraine. This is thought to be due to <i>unawareness</i> of the economic relationships and ways those might be affected by the conflict.</li>"

"1","
"
"1","So, the goal ultimately became to visualize our outcome variables (i.e., reactivity outcome and habituation) and in what ways they vary as a function of our predictor variables (i.e., geodistance and economic relationship).<br/><br/>"

"1","Our idea was to <i>weight</i> geodistance (to Kiev) and economic relationship according to the <i>absolute number of Twitter users per country</i> which is part of one of the Hedonometer’s language groups. Unfortunately, we were unable to find data on absolute numbers of Twitter users per country. We found this list of numbers instead: https://www.statista.com/statistics/242606/number-of-active-twitter-users-in-selected-countries/ <br/><br/>"

"1","
"
"1",""
"1","
"
"1","Before we learnt that there basically is an API to any data one might be in need of, we had already researched and typed in (Google spreadsheet) most geodistance and some economic relationship values by hand. The following links lead to the sites we had then used:"
