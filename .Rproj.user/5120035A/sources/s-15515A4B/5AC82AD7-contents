# 1 Introduction to the Topic
On <i>February 24, 2022</i> Russia invaded Ukraine. The invasion represents a momentous escalation of the <i>Russo-Ukrainian War</i> that has been going on since 2014. The war mainly revolves around the status of strategically significant regions (e.g., Alfarsi, 2022).<br/><br/>
Since the invasion, over 4.1 million Ukrainian citizens have suddenly had to flee their home country into the unknown (as of May 18, 2022; Global Conflict Tracker, 2022). People around the globe are moved by the horrifying circumstances Ukrainians have since been facing day-to-day. The <i>Russia-Ukraine Conflict</i> is all over the news and social media, e.g., Twitter.<br/><br/>

### 1.1 Twitter
Twitter is a popular “online, global microblog and social networking service“ (Dodds et al., 2011) with <i>500 million tweets per day by 217 million daily active users</i> (i.e., tweeters; as of February 21, 2022; Selected Company Metrics and Financials, 2022). But how do tweeters feel towards the matters they choose to address? To what extent do their tweets indicate sentiments, e.g., happiness? What words do they use to express their thoughts on the matters?<br/><br/>

### 1.2 Hedonometer
Quantifying happiness is what the <i>Hedonometer (hedonometer.org)</i> aims at: It meters (and visualizes) Twitter users’ “hedonistic“ (positive) emotions (i.e., happiness in this case). Like other sentiment analysis techniques, it assigns sentiment (happiness) scores (ranging continuously from <i>(1) least</i> to <i>(9) most happy</i>) to textual data based on the words included. To do so, it is fed with wordlists corresponding to the language the textual data is in. Wordlists related to the Hedonometer currently exist in ten different languages, e.g., English, German, Russian and Ukrainian.<br/><br/>
The Hedonometer computes the weighted average happiness of text through the following equation (Qiao & Jiang, 2022):

<p><i>Figure 1: The equation the hedonometer computes the weighted average happiness score through (Qiao & Jiang, 2022).</i></p>
<ul> 
<li>w<sub>i</sub>: word in the text</li>
<li>f<sub>i</sub>: frequency of word</li>
<li>N: number of unique words</li>
<li>h<sub>avg</sub>: average happiness</li>
<li>h<sub>avg</sub>(T): average happiness of the whole text</li>
<li>h<sub>avg</sub>(w<sub>i</sub>): average happiness of a word</li>
<li>p<sub>i</sub>: normalized frequency</li>
</ul>
  
### Some of the Hedonometer’s Advantages are:

<ul>
<li>It is capable of processing <i>large, real-time</i> textual data rapidly. This enables to gain large-scale insights into social phenomena (Dodds & Danforth, 2009; Johnson & Alluri, 2016).
</li><li>Unlike surveys, it does not depend on people’s self-reports of their emotional states (Dodds et al., 2011).
</li><li>The Hedonometer’s ways of processing data are transparent, therefore, their improvement is not restricted to its development team (Dodds & Danforth, 2009).</li>
</ul>

### 1.3 Motivation – What motivates us to work towards answering our research question (see section below)?

<ul>
<li>Since the question revolves around an (unfortunately) ongoing conflict (We obviously wish for the conflict to end as soon and peacefully as possible.), it is highly topical. The Hedonometer data is newly and continuously collected.</li>
<li>Twitter is a widely used social networking service (Dodds et al., 2011; Selected Company Metrics and Financials, 2022).</li>
<li>Our motivation to initially focus on the topic of sentiment analyses: expand what we have theoretically learnt about them in the course of a seminar (Research methods in Human-Computer Interaction 1) held by the University’s Human-Computer Interaction department in the fall semester 2021.</li>
<li>Most significantly: Terrible incidents take place every day, all around the globe. With most people having access to some sort of (online) media, news spread easily and can be commented on by anyone, speaking any language, being more or less distantly located to and (to different degrees) economically dependent on incidents’ regional origins. Usually, people feel affected by (and like discussing) incidents as long as they appear topical to them. For the most part, the time spent informing oneself, thinking and talking about incidents decreases over time, other things become personally more significant (e.g., concerning everyday life; closely related people). People are usually unaware of the economic relationships their home countries maintain with other countries in the world. Import/export are relatively abstract constructs to most people, exclusively cared about by those who can be held responsible for. Hyperbolically put, it is generally not until the newest iPhone can’t be shipped and delivered quickly to their front door, that “average“ people begin worrying about those economic relationships. It might be of interest to policymakers to increase this awareness. A thought relevant to democratic nations: An overall informed citizen also is a more competent voter.</li>
</ul>

# 2 Our project

### 2.1 Research Question & Outcome Variables

On February, 24 and the days following, a <i>drop</i> in all languages’ average happiness scores can be noticed. However, shortly after, the scores increase again. This could be due to a <i>habituation effect</i>, similar to the one regarding the COVID-19 pandemic that has been observed by Dan and Brosius (2021).<br/><br/>
We, therefore, are interested in addressing the following <i>research question:</i>

### How do average happiness scores of Twitter users tweeting in different languages develop after February, 24 (i.e., day Russia first invaded Ukraine)?

To find answers to this question, we look at two <i>outcome variables:</i>

<ul>
<li><i>Reactivity outcome:</i> average happiness scores (mean, standard deviation) <i>one day after</i> the invasion, compared to the average happiness scores <i>one day before</i> the invasion  probable drop in average happiness scores (see Hypotheses)</li>
<li><i>Habituation:</i> average happiness scores (mean, standard deviation) <i>two weeks after</i> the invasion, compared to the baseline (see next paragraph) -> tweeters in some languages will likely (already) have recovered from their “happiness drop“/returned to their baseline, while others will not have recovered entirely from their drop/will not have returned to their baseline (yet) (see Hypotheses)</li>
</ul>

A baseline (average happiness scores) is needed for the above outcome variables:</i>

<ul>
<li><i>Baseline:</i> average happiness scores <i>one month prior</i> to the invasion</li>
</ul>

We collected further data on the countries speaking one of the Hedonometer languages:

<ul>
<li>Their capital via [API]:
These data were used to calculate each country’s (capital’s) <i>geodistance to Ukraine (Kiev) in kilometers</i>.</li>
<li>A balanced value of <i>import from as well as export to Ukraine in US dollars</i> via https://data.imf.org/?sk=9d6028d4-f14a-464c-a2f2-59b2cd424b85&sId=1515619375491</li>
</ul>

We initially had intended to incorporate more variables, for instance import from and export to Russia. We then would have had to research information on sanctions possibly imposed on Russia for all countries, which would have made our analysis a lot more complex. So, we decided to stick to the most important variables: geodistance and import from/export to Ukraine.

### 2.2 Hypotheses

<ul>
<li>On <i>Geodistance:</i> We hypothesize that geodistance has a systematic effect on people’s affectedness (operationalized as the development of their happiness scores): Twitter users who are geographically <i>less</i> (vs. more) distantly located to Ukraine (i.e., hotspot of the conflict) therefore are expected to show <i>stronger</i> drops in their average happiness scores (reactivity outcome) and (therefore) take <i>longer</i> (i.e., more days since the invasion) to recover from the drop/still not have returned to their baseline (habituation).</li>
<li>On <i>Economic relationship:</i> We hypothesize that countries’ economic relationship to Ukraine does <i>not</i> have a systematic effect on people’s affectedness (operationalized as the development of their happiness scores): Twitter users therefore are expected to show a development of their average happiness scores (reactivity outcome) and time to return to their baseline (habituation) that is <i>not</i> systematically related to their countries’ economic relationship to Ukraine. This is thought to be due to <i>unawareness</i> of the economic relationships and ways those might be affected by the conflict.</li>
</ul>

### 2.3 Methodology

We were advised to focus on data <i>visualization</i>, as <i>(1)</i> this would be most effective to communicate our results to any audience not familiar with our project, and because <i>(2)</i> the time to work on our project was limited.<br/><br/>
So, the goal ultimately became to visualize our outcome variables (i.e., reactivity outcome and habituation) and in what ways they vary as a function of our predictor variables (i.e., geodistance and economic relationship).<br/><br/>
We first collected the processed data from hedonometer.org as well as the variables Language, Capital and Iso2 code (i.e., standard code) for all relevant countries.<br/><br/>
[Work in progress.]

# 3 Difficulties & Learnings

### 3.1 Languages ≠ Countries

Hedonometrics only differentiate between tweeters’ languages, not the countries they are located in. We therefore were challenged to find a way to still fit the data to our research question. We decided to focus on countries’ <i>first national language</i>.<br/><br/>
<i>Countries</i> in which <i>languages</i> included in the “Hedonometrics“ are <i>officially</i> spoken (in alphabetical order; Infoplease, 2022):

<ul>
<li><i>Spanish</i> (second most widely spoken language): Argentina; Bolivia; Chile; Colombia; Costa Rica; Cuba; Dominican Republic; East Timor; Ecuador; El Salvador; Equatorial Guinea; Guatemala; Honduras; Mexico; Micronesia; Nicaragua; Panama; Paraguay; Peru; Spain; Uruguay; Venezuela</li>
<li><i>English</i> (third most widely spoken language): Antigua and Barbuda; Barbados; Belize; Botswana; Burundi; Cameroon; Canada; Cape Verde; Dominica; Eritrea; Eswatini; Fiji; Grenada; Guyana; Ireland; Kenya; Kiribati; Lesotho; Liberia; Malawi; Malta; Namibia; New Zealand; Nigeria; Pakistan; Palau; Palestinian State; Papua New Guinea; Philippines; Rwanda; Samoa; Seychelles; Sierra Leone; Singapore; Solomon Islands; South Africa; South Sudan; Sudan; Tanzania; Tonga; Trinidad and Tobago; Tuvalu; Uganda; United Kingdom; United States; Vanuatu; Zambia; Zimbabwe</li>
<li><i>Arabic</i> (fifth most widely spoken language): Algeria; Bahrain; Chad; Comoros; Djibouti; Egypt; Eritrea; Iraq; Jordan; Kuwait; Lebanon; Libya; Mauritania; Morocco; Oman; Qatar; Saudi Arabia; Somalia; Sudan; Syria; Tunisia; United Arab Emirates; Yemen</li>
<li><i>Portuguese</i> (seventh most widely spoken language): Angola; Brazil; Equatorial Guinea; Guinea-Bissau; Mozambique; Myanmar; Portugal; Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe</li>
<li><i>Russian</i> (eighth most widely spoken language): Belarus; Kazakhstan; Kyrgyzstan; Russia</li>
<li><i>Chinese:</i> China; Taiwan</li>
<li><i>French:</i> Belgium; Benin; Burkina Faso; Burundi; Cameroon; Canada; Cape Verde; Central African Republic; Chad; Comoros; Democratic Republic of the Congo; Republic of Congo; Côte d’Ivoire; Djibouti; Equatorial Guinea; France; Gabon; Gambia; Guinea; Haiti; Luxembourg; Madagascar; Mali; Monaco; Niger; Rwanda; Senegal; Seychelles; Switzerland; Togo; Vanuatu</li>
<li><i>German:</i> Austria; Belgium; Germany; Italy; Liechtenstein; Luxembourg; Switzerland</li>
<li><i>Korean:</i> North Korea; South Korea</li>
<li><i>Ukrainian:</i> Ukraine</li>
</ul>

### 3.2 Non-availability of Absolute Number of Twitter Users per Country

Our idea was to <i>weight</i> geodistance (to Kiev) and economic relationship according to the <i>absolute number of Twitter users per country</i> which is part of one of the Hedonometer’s language groups. Unfortunately, we were unable to find data on absolute numbers of Twitter users per country. We found this list of numbers instead: https://www.statista.com/statistics/242606/number-of-active-twitter-users-in-selected-countries/ <br/><br/>
However, only thirteen of the 20 listed countries speak one of the Hedonometer’s language.<br/><br/>
We therefore were advised to still use this list, but to set the weight of countries not mentioned in the list to the minimum value in the list.

### 3.3 Manually generated Data vs. APIs

Before we learnt that there basically is an API to any data one might be in need of, we had already researched and typed in (Google spreadsheet) most geodistance and some economic relationship values by hand. The following links lead to the sites we had then used:

<ul>
<li>Geodistance: https://www.distance.to/</li>
<li>Economic relationship: https://oec.world/en/profile/country/ukr</li>
</ul>

Obviously, this manual approach was time-consuming and non-necessary – and we for sure were glad to learn about the APIs – after all, it at least helped to get a first feel for the data.
