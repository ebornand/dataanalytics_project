# Introduction
On <i>February, 24, 2022</i> Russia invaded Ukraine. The invasion represents a momentous escalation of the <i>Russo-Ukrainian War</i> that has been going on since 2014. The war mainly revolves around the status of strategically significant regions (e.g., Alfarsi, 2022).<br/><br/>
Since the invasion, over 4.1 million Ukrainian citizens have suddenly had to flee their home country into the unknown (as of April, 1, 2022; Global Conflict Tracker, 2022). People around the globe are moved by the horrifying circumstances Ukrainians are facing day-to-day. The <i>Russia-Ukraine Conflict</i> is all over the news and social media, e.g., Twitter.<br/><br/>
Twitter is a popular “online, global microblog and social networking service“ (Dodds et al., 2011) with <i>500 million tweets per day by 217 million daily active users</i> (tweeters; as of February, 21, 2022; Selected Company Metrics and Financials, 2022). But how do tweeters feel towards the matter they choose to address? To what extent do their tweets indicate sentiments, e.g., happiness? What words do they use to express their thoughts on the matter?<br/><br/>
Quantifying happiness is what the <i>hedonometer (hedonometer.org)</i> aims at: It meters (and visualizes) Twitter users’ “hedonistic“ (positive) emotions (i.e., happiness in this case). Like other sentiment analysis techniques, it assigns sentiment (happiness) scores (ranging continuously from <i>(1) least</i> to <i>(9) most happy</i>) to textual data based on the words included. To do so, it is fed with wordlists corresponding to the language the textual data is in. Wordlists related to the hedonometer currently exist in ten different languages, e.g., English, German, Russian, and Ukrainian.<br/><br/>
The hedonometer computes the weighted average happiness of texts through the following equation (Qiao & Jiang, 2022):

<p>Figure 1: The equation the hedonometer computes the weighted average happiness score through (Qiao & Jiang, 2022).</p>
<ul> 
<li>wi: word in the text</li>
<li>fi: frequency of word</li>
<li>N: number of unique words</li>
<li>havg: average happiness</li>
<li>havg(T): average happiness of the whole text</li>
<li>havg(wi): average happiness of a word</li>
<li>pi: normalized frequency</li>
</ul>
  
### Some of the hedonometer’s advantages are:
<ul>
<li>It is capable of processing <i>large, real-time</i> textual data rapidly. This enables to gain large-scale insights into social phenomena on (Dodds & Danforth, 2009; Johnson & Alluri, 2016).
</li><li>Unlike surveys, it does not depend on people’s self-reports of their emotional states (Dodds et al., 2011).
</li><li>Its ways of processing data are transparent, therefore their improvement is not restricted to the development team (Dodds & Danforth, 2009).</li>
</ul>

On February, 24 and the days following, a <i>dip</i> in all languages’ average happiness scores can be noticed. However, shortly after, the scores normalize again. This could be due to a <i>habituation effect</i>, similar to the one regarding the COVID-19 pandemic that that has been observed by Dan and Brosius (2021).<br/><br/>
We therefore are interested in finding answers to the following <i>research question: How fast do average happiness scores of Twitter users tweeting in different languages normalize after February, 24 (i.e., beginning of the Russia-Ukraine Conflict; compared to their average happiness scores before February, 24)?</i><br/><br/>
 
### What motivates us to work towards answering our research question?
<ul>
<li>Since it revolves around an ongoing conflict, it is highly topical. The data is newly collected.</li>
<li>Twitter is a widely used social networking service (Dodds et al., 2011; Selected Company Metrics and Financials, 2022).</li>
<li>Our motivation for focusing on the topic of sentiment analyses: expand what we have theoretically learnt about them in the course of a seminar held by the University’s Human-Computer Interaction department in the fall semester 2021.</li>
